/**
 * I converted the SCSS mixin to LESS for the awesome coders like myself in response to a blog post on 37Signals - http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3271-easy-retina-ready-images-using-scss
 * 
 * Update: 2014-08-04 - Updated a long-standing bug where retina images were shown no matter what in the first background-image property.
 *                    - Updated retina media query to be more reliable ()
 * Update: 2013-11-13 - Picked up another technique thanks to reading this post from Tyler Tate, auto-fill in the second filename for the retina image, http://tylertate.com/blog/2013/06/11/retina-images-using-media-queries-and-LESS-CSS.html
 * Update: 2013-04-16 - Have recently found a few use cases when using a retina pattern from Subtle Patterns on the <body>, this has come in handy
 * Update: 2013-04-05 - Some research in the Wordpress Core(http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22238#comment:5) was pointed out that some tests may be redundant (Thanks @kbav) so I've cleaned these up
 * Update: 2012-12-29 - Updated AGAIN to add MS IE10 declaration and fix wonky 'min--moz-' declaration which Mozilla engineers are aware of
 * Update: 2012-11-21 - Updated again based on information from an article I found, added dppx and changed opera ratio to target more devices (http://www.uifuel.com/hd-retina-display-media-queries/)
 * Update: 2012-11-17 - Updated based on Wordpress Core to target even more devices! Thanks @Wordpress <3 (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/22629)
